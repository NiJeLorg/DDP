              <p className='main-text__black'>The BIZ is guided by rules set out in a BIZ Plan and governed by a Board of Directors. On April 15, 2014, property owners approved the Downtown <a href="http://downtowndetroit.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIZ_Zone-Plan-legal-format.pdf">BIZ Plan</a>, which establishes a formula for BIZ assessment calculations, rules for governing the election of Board members and the scope of projects the BIZ will undertake. The BIZ charges the BIZ Board of Directors, a volunteer group of Downtown leaders, with the responsibility of creating a budget that aligns with the BIZ service delivery goals and needs. The BIZ plan is valid for ten years.
